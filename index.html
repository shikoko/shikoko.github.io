                    Experienced Android developer with 7 years of experience. I’ve been developing on Android since version 2.3 (Gingerbread). I’ve worked on many Android projects over the past few years and have a deep and varied knowledge of Android including both the framework and the device ecosystem in general. I also have an interest in UX and UI and enjoy getting involved with designing experiences that work well for the users of the apps that I work on.
